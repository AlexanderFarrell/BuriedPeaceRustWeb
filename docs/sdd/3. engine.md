# 3. Engine

## 3.1 Overview

### 3.1.1 Goals

Key attributes of the engine include the following:

- Systemic Gameplay
- Player Agency
- Simplicity
- Development Ease

### 3.1.2 Engine Overview - Cycle

The engine consists of four foundational parts.

- Player
- World
- Input
- Output

### 3.1.3 Cycle Concept

All four of these make up a cycle.

    Player ----( Input  )----> World

    World  ----( Output )----> Player

### 3.1.4 Definitions

Let us define what each one does.

Component   | Definition
------------|----------------------
Player      | The player and their preferences / settings.
World       | The game and its logic
Input       | The input received from the user
Output      | Presents the world to the user

### 3.1.5 Examples

Each can have sub-components, of which some examples include:

Component   | Examples
------------|------
Player      | Name, Platform, Saved Profile
World       | Physics, Game Logic, Characters, Terrain
Input       | Keyboard, Mouse, Touch, Controller, Buttons, Checkboxes
Output      | Visual (Graphics), Audio, Tactile, Tone, Views

### 3.1.6 Islands

Two components are "islands": separate concepts we want to build bridges to.

- Player - The person (or machine in some cases) playing the game
- World - The virtual game environment, with characters, entities, systems, laws, etc.

### 3.1.7 Bridges

Two components are "bridges": one-way means of both islands communicating with one another.

- Input - **Player** sends messages to the *world*
- Output - **World** sends messages to the *player*

## 3.2 Player

### 3.2.1 Purpose

**Purpose**: Represents the information and preferences of the user.

### 3.2.2 Overview

Player is divided into three parts:

### 3.2.3 Structure

Player has generics for info, platform and preferences. Info and preferences are optionals.

Each game can define their own info, platforms and preferences.

#### 3.2.3.1 PlayerInfo

Each game defines its own player info, which keeps track of player information.

*Examples*: Name, Groups player is in, Saved Game Data specific to a player.

### 3.2.3.2 PlayerPlatform

Each build defines its own PlayerPlatform. The player constructor requires a PlayerPlatform to be initialized.

### 3.2.3.3 PlayerPreferences

Each game defines its own player settings, such as sound volume or graphics settings.

## 3.2.4 Start
